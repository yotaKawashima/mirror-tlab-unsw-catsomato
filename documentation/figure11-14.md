**Notes** 
+ Run this script before running other scripts related to model fitting.
+ This file saves 'Harmonics_IMs_top10.mat' in the script directory, the mat file that is required for model fitting analysis.

## File: run_rect_batch.sh and run_sq_batch.sh ##

**File discription** <br />
  Slurm script to run matlab functions to fit models to top 10% channels

**Data dependencies**
+ figure_scripts/11-14-simulation/Harmonics_IMs_top10.mat

**Notes** 
+ Use this slurm file if you have access to a supercomputer with slurm system.
+ Replace ???? with your account, user name, and email address in the file and rect_top10_batch.sh and sq_top10_batch.sh.
+ Use run_rect_sq_with_matlab.m instead if you do not have access to a supercomputer. I have not tried this script, so I am not sure how long it would take. 
+ Run concatenate_fitting_results_from_massive.m after getting the results.

## File: concatenate_fitting_results_from_massive.m ##

**File discription** <br />
  Combine mat file containing model fitting results for each channel into one matlab structure. This script returns Resluts_Rect_top10_v2.m and Results_Sq_top10_v2.m, which are required for further analysis.
